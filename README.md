## Hello, I'm Willy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a coding instructor with 5+ years of experience teaching students of all ages, from kids learning Scratch to adults preparing for careers in tech. I teach programming fundamentals to help students get into computer science programs, and I teach bootcamp courses focused on Full-Stack JavaScript to prepare students for job placement.

Beyond teaching, I enjoy practicing public speaking to improve my communication skills, and I stay active with regular workouts. I'm always excited to inspire more people to start coding and pursue their goals.

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to connect, collaborate, or learn more about my work!
